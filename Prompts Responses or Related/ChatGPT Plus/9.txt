## Section 3: Writing in APA Style  

### Page 11: Introduction to Writing in APA Style  

Writing in APA Style is not just about following formatting rules—it is about maintaining **clarity, precision, and professionalism** in academic writing. APA emphasizes structured writing, bias-free language, and clear communication to ensure research is presented effectively.  

Students new to APA Style often focus solely on citation rules, but **APA also provides guidelines for how content should be written**. These writing guidelines help ensure that research papers and essays maintain an academic tone while remaining accessible to readers.  

This section will cover the essential aspects of writing in APA Style, including:  

- Clarity and conciseness  
- Academic tone and objectivity  
- Bias-free language  
- Proper use of tenses  
- The difference between common practice and valid APA writing styles  

By understanding these principles, students can improve their writing while ensuring their papers adhere to APA standards.  

### Page 12: Clarity and Conciseness in APA Writing  

One of the core principles of APA Style is **clarity**. Academic writing should be direct and free of unnecessary complexity. Readers should be able to understand key points without struggling through overly complicated sentences.  

#### Guidelines for Clear Writing  

- **Avoid wordiness:** Keep sentences concise by eliminating unnecessary words.  
  - Wordy: *Due to the fact that many students experience stress, they oftentimes struggle with academic performance.*  
  - Concise: *Many students experience stress, which negatively impacts academic performance.*  

- **Use simple, direct language:** Avoid jargon or overly complex vocabulary when a simpler word will suffice.  
  - Unclear: *The researcher utilized an extensive array of methodologies to ascertain results.*  
  - Clear: *The researcher used multiple methods to determine results.*  

- **Use active voice when possible:** Active voice makes writing more engaging and direct.  
  - Passive: *The experiment was conducted by the researchers.*  
  - Active: *The researchers conducted the experiment.*  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Writing  

- **Common Practice:** Many students use passive voice to sound more formal.  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA prefers active voice but allows passive voice when necessary (e.g., when the actor is unknown or unimportant).  

Writing with clarity improves the reader’s experience and ensures that the research is communicated effectively.  

### Page 13: Academic Tone and Objectivity  

APA Style requires **a formal and objective tone** in academic writing. Unlike casual or creative writing, APA discourages opinion-based statements unless they are supported by evidence.  

#### Principles of Academic Tone  

- **Avoid personal opinions unless discussing personal reflections:**  
  - Informal: *I think social media is harmful to students.*  
  - Formal: *Research suggests that excessive social media use negatively affects students (Smith, 2020).*  

- **Avoid contractions:**  
  - Incorrect: *The study didn’t find any significant results.*  
  - Correct: *The study did not find any significant results.*  

- **Avoid emotionally charged language:**  
  - Incorrect: *It is absolutely ridiculous how much stress college students endure.*  
  - Correct: *College students experience high levels of stress (Jones, 2021).*  

- **Use precise language:** Avoid vague words like “many” or “a lot” unless supported by data.  
  - Vague: *A lot of students struggle with anxiety.*  
  - Precise: *A national study found that 64% of students report experiencing anxiety (Doe, 2022).*  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Writing  

- **Common Practice:** Many students include personal opinions and informal phrases in their writing.  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA allows personal reflection in some contexts, such as discussion sections, but it should still be evidence-based.  

### Page 14: Bias-Free Language in APA Style  

APA 7th Edition emphasizes the use of **inclusive and bias-free language**. Writers should be mindful of how they describe people, ensuring that language is respectful and free of stereotypes.  

#### Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing  

- **Use gender-neutral language when possible:**  
  - Incorrect: *Each student must bring his book to class.*  
  - Correct: *Each student must bring their book to class.*  

- **Refer to groups appropriately:**  
  - Incorrect: *The elderly struggle with technology.*  
  - Correct: *Older adults may have difficulty using technology.*  

- **Avoid outdated or offensive terminology:**  
  - Incorrect: *Mentally ill patients were studied.*  
  - Correct: *Participants with mental health conditions were studied.*  

- **Be specific when referring to groups:**  
  - Vague: *People from different cultures participated in the study.*  
  - Specific: *Participants from Mexico, Japan, and Canada participated in the study.*  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Writing  

- **Common Practice:** Many students use traditional gendered language (e.g., “he or she”).  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA allows for singular “they” as a gender-neutral pronoun.  

Bias-free writing ensures that research is respectful and inclusive, aligning with modern academic standards.  

### Page 15: Proper Use of Tenses in APA Writing  

APA Style requires **specific verb tenses** depending on the section of the paper. Using the correct tense improves readability and ensures that research is presented clearly.  

#### Tense Guidelines for APA Writing  

- **Past tense (was, found, examined)** is used for discussing past research, methods, and results.  
  - Example: *Smith (2020) found that social media usage increased stress levels among students.*  

- **Present perfect tense (has been, have studied)** is used for discussing past research that is still relevant.  
  - Example: *Researchers have studied the effects of social media on student performance for years.*  

- **Present tense (is, states, suggests)** is used for discussing general truths or ongoing debates.  
  - Example: *Current research suggests that sleep deprivation impairs memory retention.*  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Writing  

- **Common Practice:** Students often mix tenses throughout their papers.  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA allows some flexibility in tense usage but prefers consistency within sections.  

By following these tense guidelines, writers ensure that their research is presented accurately and professionally.  

### Summary  

Writing in APA Style requires clarity, objectivity, and bias-free language. By understanding the principles of academic tone, proper tense usage, and inclusive writing, students can improve the quality of their research papers.
