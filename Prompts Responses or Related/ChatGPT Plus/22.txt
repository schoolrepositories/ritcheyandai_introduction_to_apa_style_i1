## Section 14: Advanced APA Citation Issues  

### Page 66: Introduction to Advanced APA Citation Issues  

While most citations in APA Style follow standard formats, researchers and students frequently encounter sources that do not fit neatly into traditional categories. Advanced citation issues arise when citing unusual sources, handling missing information, or referencing secondary sources.  

This section will address:  

- Citing sources with missing information (e.g., no author, no date, no page numbers)  
- Citing secondary sources (i.e., citing a source that cites another source)  
- Citing unpublished or personal communications  
- Handling multiple works by the same author  
- Citing non-traditional sources such as government documents, AI-generated content, and interviews  

By mastering these citation techniques, writers can ensure accuracy and maintain academic integrity in their work.  

### Page 67: Citing Sources with Missing Information  

In some cases, a source may lack an author, date, or page numbers. APA provides specific guidelines for handling these situations.  

#### No Author  

- Use the **title of the work** in place of the author.  
- Italicize book or report titles; use quotation marks for articles or webpages.  

**Example:**  
*"Effects of Climate Change"* (2020) argues that rising sea levels will displace millions.  

**Reference List Example:**  
Effects of climate change. (2020). National Environmental Research Institute.  

#### No Date  

- Use **(n.d.)** in place of the publication year.  

**Example:**  
Smith (n.d.) found that students who study daily perform better on exams.  

**Reference List Example:**  
Smith, J. (n.d.). *The impact of study habits on academic performance.* University Press.  

#### No Page Numbers (for Online Sources)  

- If a source lacks page numbers, use **paragraph numbers (para. 4)** or **section headings**.  

**Example:**  
According to Brown (2021), "consistent study habits improve test scores" (para. 5).  

**Example with Section Heading:**  
Brown (2021) states that "exam preparation strategies vary among students" (*Study Habits* section).  

Common mistakes include omitting citation details entirely or misplacing punctuation when citing paragraph numbers.  

### Page 68: Citing Secondary Sources  

A **secondary source citation** is used when one author cites another author’s work, and you do not have access to the original source. APA recommends citing the primary source when possible, but if only the secondary source is available, follow this format:  

**In-Text Citation Format:**  
(Primary Author, Year, as cited in Secondary Author, Year)  

**Example:**  
Freud’s early studies on personality theory suggested that childhood experiences shape adulthood (Freud, 1900, as cited in Jones, 2021).  

**Reference List Entry:**  
- Cite only the **secondary source** (Jones, 2021).  

**Reference List Example:**  
Jones, M. (2021). *The evolution of personality theories.* Academic Press.  

Common mistakes include incorrectly listing the primary source in the reference list or failing to clarify that the information comes from a secondary source.  

### Page 69: Citing Unpublished or Personal Communications  

#### Citing Unpublished Sources  

Unpublished sources include manuscripts, preprints, and classroom lecture notes. These should be cited differently depending on their availability.  

**Format for Unpublished Manuscript:**  
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of the manuscript.* Unpublished manuscript, Institution.  

**Example:**  
Taylor, L. (2020). *The impact of stress on student motivation.* Unpublished manuscript, University of California.  

**Format for a Preprint (Online Manuscript Before Peer Review):**  
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of the preprint.* Preprint repository. URL  

**Example:**  
Chen, M. (2021). *AI ethics in modern technology.* PsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.xxxx  

#### Citing Personal Communications (Emails, Interviews, and Conversations)  

Personal communications include private messages, emails, interviews, and unpublished conversations. Because they **cannot be retrieved**, they are cited only in-text and **not** included in the reference list.  

**Example In-Text Citation:**  
According to J. Smith (personal communication, March 10, 2022), sleep deprivation is a growing concern among college students.  

Common mistakes include incorrectly adding personal communications to the reference list or failing to specify the type of communication.  

### Page 70: Citing Non-Traditional and AI-Generated Sources  

#### Citing Government Documents and Reports  

Government reports require specific formatting to include agency details.  

**Format:**  
Government Agency. (Year). *Title of the report* (Report No. if available). URL  

**Example:**  
U.S. Department of Education. (2020). *Student loan statistics 2020* (ED-5678). https://www.ed.gov/reports/studentloans  

#### Citing AI-Generated Content (e.g., ChatGPT)  

APA now provides guidance on citing AI-generated content. Since AI responses are **non-retrievable**, cite them as personal communications **unless they come from a documented source**.  

**Example In-Text Citation (Personal Communication):**  
ChatGPT stated that "machine learning continues to evolve rapidly" (OpenAI, personal communication, March 10, 2023).  

**Example for Documented AI Reports (Retrievable Source):**  
OpenAI. (2023). *The role of AI in modern computing.* https://www.openai.com/research/ai-computing  

#### Citing Social Media and Online Forums  

Social media and forums require author attribution and platform details.  

**Example Tweet Citation:**  
Musk, E. [@elonmusk]. (2022, May 15). AI will transform industries faster than most expect. [Tweet]. Twitter. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/123456789  

#### Common Mistakes in Advanced Citations  

- Failing to distinguish between primary and secondary sources.  
- Adding personal communications to the reference list.  
- Forgetting to use "(n.d.)" for sources without a publication date.  
- Misformatting AI-generated citations by failing to indicate their non-retrievable nature.  

### Summary  

Citing sources accurately in APA Style requires handling missing information, secondary citations, unpublished materials, and non-traditional sources correctly. This section provided strategies for citing government reports, AI-generated content, and personal communications while ensuring proper APA compliance.
