## Section 12: Writing an APA Literature Review  

### Page 56: Introduction to Writing an APA Literature Review  

A literature review is a critical component of academic writing that synthesizes existing research on a specific topic. Unlike a traditional research paper, a literature review does not present original findings but instead evaluates and organizes past studies to identify trends, gaps, and areas for further research.  

An APA literature review should:  

- Summarize key studies related to the research question  
- Critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of past research  
- Identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future study  
- Provide a clear framework that supports the paper’s research objectives  

There are different types of literature reviews, including:  

- **Stand-alone literature reviews** – Written as independent papers summarizing the state of research on a topic.  
- **Embedded literature reviews** – Included as a section within a research paper to provide background on prior studies.  

This section will cover the structure of an APA literature review, how to organize sources, and best practices for citing research.  

### Page 57: Structuring an APA Literature Review  

An APA literature review follows a structured format similar to other academic papers but focuses on evaluating prior research.  

#### Components of a Literature Review  

1. **Title Page** – Follows standard APA formatting.  
2. **Abstract (if required)** – A brief summary of the review, typically between 150-250 words.  
3. **Introduction** – Introduces the topic, research question, and purpose of the review.  
4. **Main Body** – Organizes the literature using a logical structure (e.g., thematic, chronological, methodological).  
5. **Conclusion** – Summarizes key findings, identifies gaps, and suggests directions for future research.  
6. **References** – Lists all sources cited in APA format.  

The main body can be structured in several ways:  

- **Thematic organization** – Groups studies by common themes or findings.  
- **Chronological organization** – Arranges studies by publication date to show research progression.  
- **Methodological organization** – Groups studies based on research design or methodology.  

**Example of Thematic Organization:**  

- *Effects of Stress on Academic Performance*  
- *Coping Mechanisms for Stress in College Students*  
- *Intervention Strategies for Reducing Academic Stress*  

A well-organized literature review helps readers understand key trends in the field and how different studies relate to each other.  

### Page 58: Writing the Introduction and Main Body  

#### Introduction  

The introduction of a literature review provides an overview of the topic, explains why the review is necessary, and outlines the structure of the paper.  

**Example Introduction Paragraph:**  

Over the past two decades, research has shown a growing interest in the relationship between sleep and academic performance. Multiple studies have suggested that inadequate sleep negatively affects cognitive function and student success (Brown, 2019; Smith & Lee, 2020). However, there is ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness of various sleep interventions in improving academic outcomes. This literature review examines existing research on sleep deprivation, its impact on students, and the role of structured interventions in mitigating negative effects.  

#### Writing the Main Body  

The main body synthesizes research by organizing sources into meaningful categories. Each paragraph should summarize multiple studies and show how they relate to each other.  

**Example Thematic Paragraph:**  

Studies indicate that students who experience chronic sleep deprivation tend to have lower academic performance than their well-rested peers. Smith and Lee (2020) found that students who slept fewer than six hours per night had significantly lower test scores than those who slept at least eight hours. Similarly, Johnson et al. (2021) reported that sleep-deprived students displayed reduced concentration and slower cognitive processing. However, some researchers argue that study habits and caffeine consumption may moderate the negative effects of sleep loss (Davis, 2018).  

Each paragraph should:  

- Begin with a clear **topic sentence** that introduces the theme.  
- Integrate multiple studies to **show connections and differences** between findings.  
- Use **in-text citations** appropriately.  
- Provide **critical analysis** rather than just summarizing findings.  

Common mistakes include listing studies without synthesizing them, failing to identify contradictions in research, and not discussing methodological limitations.  

### Page 59: Critical Analysis and Identifying Research Gaps  

A strong literature review does more than summarize studies—it evaluates their **strengths, weaknesses, and limitations**.  

#### How to Critically Analyze Research  

- **Assess study design** – Were the sample sizes adequate? Were the methods appropriate?  
- **Evaluate consistency** – Do studies support each other, or are there conflicting results?  
- **Identify gaps** – What questions remain unanswered?  

**Example Critical Analysis Paragraph:**  

While multiple studies support the link between sleep deprivation and academic performance, several methodological limitations must be considered. Most studies rely on self-reported sleep data, which can introduce bias (Garcia & Patel, 2020). Additionally, few studies have examined the long-term impact of chronic sleep deprivation beyond a single academic semester. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies with objective sleep tracking methods.  

#### Identifying Research Gaps  

- **What hasn’t been studied?** – Are there populations or variables that have been overlooked?  
- **What needs further exploration?** – Do studies contradict each other? Are additional experiments needed?  
- **What practical applications are missing?** – Could findings be used for policy changes or interventions?  

**Example of Identifying a Research Gap:**  

Although studies confirm that sleep deprivation harms academic performance, little research has examined the impact of structured sleep education programs in improving student outcomes. Future studies should explore whether university-led sleep interventions lead to measurable improvements in GPA.  

Common mistakes include failing to engage critically with sources, ignoring contradictory findings, and not discussing study limitations.  

### Page 60: Writing the Conclusion and Formatting References  

#### Writing the Conclusion  

The conclusion summarizes key findings, discusses research limitations, and suggests future research directions.  

**Example Conclusion Paragraph:**  

This literature review highlights the significant impact of sleep deprivation on academic performance. While numerous studies confirm that reduced sleep negatively affects cognitive function, limitations in study design—such as reliance on self-reported data—suggest the need for further research. Future studies should focus on long-term interventions and experimental sleep programs to better understand their effects on student success.  

A strong conclusion should:  

- **Summarize key points** without introducing new research.  
- **Emphasize gaps** that future studies should address.  
- **Reinforce the relevance** of the topic.  

#### Formatting the Reference List  

A literature review’s reference list must include **all sources cited in the text**. The references should:  

- Be **listed alphabetically** by author’s last name.  
- Use **hanging indentation** (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches).  
- Be **double-spaced** without extra lines between entries.  

**Example References:**

Common mistakes in reference formatting include improper italics, missing DOIs, and incorrect author formatting.  

### Summary  

A well-structured literature review synthesizes existing research, critically evaluates sources, and identifies gaps in knowledge. This section covered the essential components of an APA literature review, including its structure, organization, and formatting guidelines.
