## Section 5: Reference List Formatting  

### Page 21: Introduction to Reference List Formatting  

The reference list is a crucial part of any APA-formatted paper. It provides full bibliographic information for every source cited in the text, allowing readers to locate and verify those sources. Unlike in-text citations, which briefly identify sources, the reference list offers complete details about each work.  

A properly formatted reference list should:  

- Appear **on a new page** at the end of the document  
- Be titled **References** (bolded and centered)  
- Include all sources cited in the paper (and no additional sources)  
- Be **alphabetized** by the last name of the first author  
- Use **hanging indentation**, where the first line of each reference is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented by 0.5 inches  
- Be **double-spaced** with no extra spaces between entries  

This section will cover the structure of an APA reference list, the proper formatting of different source types, and common citation mistakes.  

### Page 22: General Formatting Rules for the Reference List  

#### Basic Structure of a Reference Entry  

Most reference entries in APA Style follow this structure:  

**Author(s). (Year). Title of the work. Source (Publisher, Journal Name, Website). URL or DOI**  

#### Example of a Journal Article Reference  

**Smith, J. A. (2020). The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance. *Journal of Behavioral Neuroscience, 12*(3), 45–62. https://doi.org/10.xxxxx**  

#### Example of a Book Reference  

**Brown, T. R. (2018). *The psychology of learning and memory.* Academic Press.**  

#### Example of a Website Reference  

**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2021). Managing stress during the pandemic. https://www.cdc.gov/stress-pandemic**  

#### Alphabetization Rules  

- References should be **arranged alphabetically** by the last name of the first author.  
- If two sources have the **same author**, order them by publication year (earliest first).  
- If two sources have **identical authors and years**, add a lowercase letter to differentiate them (e.g., 2020a, 2020b).  

Example:  

**Jones, R. (2020a). Social media and mental health. Oxford University Press.**  
**Jones, R. (2020b). The impact of technology on relationships. Cambridge University Press.**  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Formatting  

- **Common Practice:** Many students forget to use hanging indentation, resulting in misaligned references.  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA allows minor stylistic variations in reference lists as long as consistency is maintained.  

### Page 23: Formatting Different Types of References  

#### Journal Articles  

**Format:**  
**Author, A. A. (Year). Title of the article. *Title of the Journal, Volume*(Issue), Page range. DOI or URL**  

**Examples:**  

- One author:  
  **Garcia, M. L. (2019). The role of motivation in academic success. *Journal of Educational Psychology, 25*(2), 112–128. https://doi.org/10.1234**  

- Multiple authors:  
  **Taylor, B. A., & Lee, J. H. (2021). Online learning strategies for college students. *Higher Education Review, 18*(4), 214–230. https://doi.org/10.5678**  

- More than 20 authors:  
  List the first 19 authors, then use an ellipsis before the last author.  
  **Johnson, R. A., Smith, K. B., ... Thompson, L. (2020). Cognitive development in early childhood. *Developmental Science, 15*(1), 89–104. https://doi.org/10.9876**  

#### Books  

**Format:**  
**Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of the book.* Publisher.**  

**Examples:**  

- One author:  
  **Miller, S. R. (2020). *Introduction to behavioral psychology.* Academic Press.**  

- Two authors:  
  **Nelson, R. T., & Carter, J. P. (2018). *The history of cognitive neuroscience.* Springer.**  

- Edited book:  
  **Jones, L. R. (Ed.). (2015). *Advances in psychological research.* Wiley.**  

#### Websites  

**Format:**  
**Author or Organization. (Year). Title of the webpage. URL**  

**Examples:**  

- Individual author:  
  **Smith, J. (2021). How to improve study habits. https://www.example.com/study-tips**  

- Organization as author:  
  **World Health Organization. (2020). Global health trends. https://www.who.int/global-trends**  

#### Common Practice vs. Valid APA Formatting  

- **Common Practice:** Students often copy URLs without formatting them properly.  
- **Valid but Less Common:** APA allows URLs to be hyperlinked but prefers them to remain plain text in academic writing.  

### Page 24: Handling Special Cases in References  

#### Missing Information  

If any information is missing, follow these APA guidelines:  

- **No author:** Use the title in place of the author.  
  - *(Managing Anxiety, 2019).  
  - **Managing anxiety. (2019). https://www.example.com**  

- **No date:** Use (n.d.) in place of the year.  
  - **Taylor, K. (n.d.). The importance of nutrition. https://www.health.org**  

- **No page numbers:** Use paragraph numbers or section headings for online sources.  
  - *(Brown, 2021, para. 4).*  

#### Citing Secondary Sources  

If an author quotes another author, cite the original source if possible. If not, use a secondary source citation.  

Example:  
**Smith (2015) found that memory retention improves with practice (as cited in Johnson, 2020).**  

### Page 25: Common Errors and Final Tips  

#### Common Errors in Reference Lists  

- **Incorrect hanging indentation:** References should have a 0.5-inch indent on the second and subsequent lines.  
- **Improper capitalization:** Only the first word of titles and subtitles should be capitalized, except for proper nouns.  
- **Incorrect author formatting:** Always list authors in **Last name, First initial.** format.  
- **Missing DOIs or URLs:** If available, always include a DOI or stable URL.  

#### Final Checklist for Reference Lists  

- Is the **title "References" bolded and centered**?  
- Are references **alphabetized** by the first author's last name?  
- Is **hanging indentation** applied correctly?  
- Is the **format for each source type correct**?  
- Are **URLs and DOIs properly formatted**?  
- Is the **reference list double-spaced** with no extra spaces between entries?  

By following APA reference list guidelines carefully, students ensure their sources are properly cited, maintaining the credibility and integrity of their academic writing.
