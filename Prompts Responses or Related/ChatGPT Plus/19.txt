## Section 11: Structuring APA Research Papers  

### Page 51: Introduction to Structuring APA Research Papers  

A well-structured research paper in APA Style ensures clarity, readability, and logical progression of ideas. APA guidelines provide a clear framework for organizing research papers, which helps writers communicate findings effectively.  

Every APA research paper follows a specific format that includes:  

- Title page  
- Abstract  
- Introduction  
- Method  
- Results  
- Discussion  
- References  
- Appendices (if applicable)  

Each section serves a distinct purpose and must be formatted correctly. This section will provide detailed guidance on structuring each part of an APA research paper, ensuring compliance with APA Style while maintaining logical flow.  

### Page 52: Formatting the Title Page and Abstract  

#### Title Page  

The title page is the first page of an APA research paper. It contains key information about the paper and must follow these guidelines:  

1. **Title of the paper** – Centered, bolded, in title case  
2. **Student’s name** – Centered, placed below the title  
3. **Institutional affiliation** – Centered, below the author’s name  
4. **Course name and number** – Centered, below the institutional affiliation  
5. **Instructor’s name** – Centered, below the course information  
6. **Due date** – Centered, below the instructor’s name

#### Abstract  

The abstract is a **150-250 word** summary of the paper. It provides a concise overview of the research, including the research question, methods, key findings, and implications.  

**Abstract Formatting Guidelines:**  

- The abstract appears on **a new page** after the title page.  
- The heading **"Abstract"** is **centered and bolded** at the top of the page.  
- The abstract itself is written in a **single paragraph, without indentation**.  
- Include **keywords** below the abstract to help with indexing.  

**Example Abstract:**  

This study examines the impact of sleep deprivation on academic performance among college students. A sample of 200 students completed surveys measuring their sleep patterns and GPA. Results indicate a significant correlation between reduced sleep duration and lower academic performance. Findings suggest that sleep interventions may improve student success.  

**Keywords:** sleep deprivation, academic performance, college students  

Common mistakes in abstracts include being too lengthy, lacking key findings, or failing to include keywords.  

### Page 53: Writing the Introduction Section  

The introduction provides background information, defines the research problem, and outlines the study’s purpose.  

**Introduction Structure:**  

1. **Opening Statement:** Introduces the research topic and its significance.  
2. **Review of Relevant Literature:** Summarizes previous research related to the topic.  
3. **Research Gap:** Identifies what previous studies have missed.  
4. **Research Question or Hypothesis:** States the research question or hypothesis clearly.  

**Example Introduction Paragraph:**  

College students frequently experience sleep deprivation due to academic demands. Research suggests that inadequate sleep negatively impacts cognitive function and academic performance (Smith & Lee, 2021). However, few studies have examined whether structured sleep interventions can improve academic outcomes. This study investigates the relationship between sleep patterns and academic performance among college students, hypothesizing that students with regular sleep schedules will have higher GPAs than those with irregular sleep patterns.  

Common mistakes in introductions include failing to establish the research gap, using too much background information, or lacking a clear research question.  

### Page 54: Writing the Method and Results Sections  

#### Method Section  

The **Method** section describes how the study was conducted. It is divided into:  

1. **Participants** – Describes the sample, including demographics and recruitment.  
2. **Materials/Measures** – Lists tools, surveys, or instruments used.  
3. **Procedure** – Explains the research process step by step.  

**Example Method Section:**  

#### Participants  
The study included 200 undergraduate students from University X (100 male, 100 female). Participants were recruited via email and provided informed consent.  

#### Materials  
Participants completed a sleep diary and the Academic Performance Questionnaire (APQ).  

#### Procedure  
Participants recorded their sleep duration for two weeks. They also completed the APQ to measure their academic performance.  

#### Results Section  

The **Results** section presents the study’s findings, using text, tables, or figures.  

- Results should be **reported without interpretation** (interpretation belongs in the Discussion section).  
- **Statistical analyses** should be clearly presented (e.g., correlations, t-tests).  
- Tables and figures must be **labeled properly** and referenced in the text.  

**Example Results Statement:**  

A Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between sleep duration and GPA, r = -0.42, p < .05. Students who reported sleeping fewer than six hours per night had an average GPA of 2.5, while those who slept more than seven hours had an average GPA of 3.4.  

Common mistakes include misreporting statistical results, failing to mention non-significant findings, or including unnecessary tables.  

### Page 55: Writing the Discussion and Conclusion  

#### Discussion Section  

The **Discussion** section interprets the findings, explains their significance, and compares them to previous research.  

**Structure of the Discussion Section:**  

1. **Summary of Key Findings** – Restates major results in plain language.  
2. **Comparison with Previous Research** – Explains how the findings align with or differ from existing studies.  
3. **Limitations** – Identifies any weaknesses in the study (e.g., small sample size, self-reported data).  
4. **Implications** – Discusses how the findings can be applied in real-world settings.  
5. **Suggestions for Future Research** – Identifies potential areas for further investigation.  

**Example Discussion Paragraph:**  

The results support previous studies linking sleep deprivation to reduced academic performance (Johnson et al., 2020). However, this study expands on existing research by demonstrating that structured sleep interventions may mitigate these effects. One limitation was the reliance on self-reported data, which may be subject to bias. Future research should incorporate objective sleep tracking methods.  

#### Conclusion  

The **Conclusion** summarizes the study’s overall contributions. It should be **brief** and avoid introducing new information.  

**Example Conclusion Paragraph:**  

This study highlights the negative impact of sleep deprivation on college students’ academic performance. Findings suggest that promoting healthy sleep habits may enhance student success. Future research should explore long-term interventions to improve sleep quality in academic settings.  

Common mistakes in the discussion and conclusion sections include overstating results, failing to address study limitations, or introducing new data.  

### Summary  

Structuring an APA research paper correctly ensures that information is presented clearly and logically. This section covered the title page, abstract, introduction, method, results, discussion, and conclusion.  

The next section will focus on **how to write an APA literature review**, detailing how to structure and synthesize research effectively.
